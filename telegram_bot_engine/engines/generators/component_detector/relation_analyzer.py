"""
Relation Analyzer — builds the dependency graph between detected
components (Specification 007).

The :class:`RelationAnalyzer` is a stateless helper that the
:class:`ComponentDetectionEngine` calls during the *relations* phase.
It takes the list of :class:`DetectedComponent` objects produced by the
:class:`TypeDetector` and:

1. resolves each component's ``depends_on`` list to *actual* detected
   component names (filtering out references to blueprint components
   that did not produce a detected component),
2. records the reverse ``depended_by`` links,
3. builds the list of :class:`ComponentDependencyEdge` objects that
   describe the wiring between components,
4. detects dangling dependencies (a component depends on a name that is
   not in the registry).

The analyzer does **not** create new components or modify the
blueprint.  It only wires the existing detected components together.
