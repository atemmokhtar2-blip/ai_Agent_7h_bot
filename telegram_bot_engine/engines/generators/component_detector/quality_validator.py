"""
Quality Rules Validator — enforces the quality rules for the component
registry (Specification 007).

The :class:`QualityRulesValidator` is a stateless helper that the
:class:`ComponentDetectionEngine` calls during the *validation* phase.
It checks the full component registry for these quality rules:

1. **No unused components.**  Every component must be referenced by at
   least one other component (via ``depended_by``) or be an
   entry-point / application component.  A component with no
   dependents and no dependencies is considered orphaned.
2. **No self-dependent components.**  No component may depend on
   itself (``name`` in its own ``depends_on``).
3. **No circular dependencies.**  The dependency graph must be
   acyclic.  If a cycle is detected, the validator records an error for
   each component in the cycle.
4. **No dangling dependencies.**  After the relation analyzer has
   resolved dependencies, every entry in a component's
   ``depends_on`` list must refer to a component that exists in the
   registry.

The validator does **not** modify the registry — it only records
findings.
