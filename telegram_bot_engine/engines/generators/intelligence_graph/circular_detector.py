"""
Circular detector (Specification 011).

The :class:`CircularDetector` analyses the
:class:`ProjectIntelligenceGraph` for structural problems that would
cause issues for downstream engines.  It detects:

* **Circular dependencies** — a chain of ``depends_on`` (or
  ``imports``, ``uses``, ``required_by``) edges that loops back to the
  starting node.  Circular dependencies must be broken before
  construction can proceed reliably.
* **Broken references** — an edge whose source or target node does not
  exist in the graph.  These indicate a linking error during graph
  building.
* **Unused components** — a component node that has no incoming edges
  at all (no feature references it, no other component uses it, no
  stage contains it).  Unused components may indicate over-engineering
  or a missing relationship.
* **Orphan files** — a file node that is not contained by any folder
  and not referenced by any component.  Orphan files may indicate a
  structure-map inconsistency.
* **Dead components** — a component node that has no outgoing edges
  (it does not use any dependency, does not create any file, and does
  not belong to any stage).  Dead components contribute nothing to the
  project and may indicate a planning gap.

The detector uses depth-first search (DFS) with a recursion stack to
find cycles in the directed graph of dependency-like edges.  The
algorithm runs in O(V + E) time where V is the number of nodes and E
is the number of edges in the dependency subgraph.

The detector does **not** write code, create files, or make build
decisions.  It is a pure analysis helper that produces
:class:`GraphFinding` objects.
