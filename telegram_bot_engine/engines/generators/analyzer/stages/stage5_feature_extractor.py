"""
Stage 5 — Feature extraction.

Responsibilities:
    * Identify independent features from the keyword matches.
    * Each feature is atomic — never a composite of multiple features.
    * Produce a list of :class:`Feature` objects with name, display name,
      description, keywords, confidence, and related entities.
    * Do NOT merge features.  If the user says "warning and mute system",
      two separate features are produced.

A feature is triggered when one or more keywords in the ``"feature"``
category are present in the request.  Each canonical feature keyword
maps to exactly one :class:`Feature`.
