"""
Dependency Resolution Report data model (Specification 009).

This module defines the :class:`DependencyResolutionReport` — the
complete, authoritative dependency map for every library, framework,
and tool that the generated Telegram bot project will use **before**
any code is written or any file is created on disk.  It is the single
artefact produced by the
:class:`~telegram_bot_engine.engines.generators.dependency_resolver.DependencyResolutionEngine`.

The report is built from **five** read-only artefacts:

1. the ``project_blueprint`` (produced by the Project Planning Engine),
2. the ``blueprint_validation_report`` (produced by the Blueprint
   Validator Engine),
3. the ``project_structure_map`` (produced by the Structure Generation
   Engine),
4. the ``component_registry`` (produced by the Component Detection
   Engine),
5. the ``file_generation_plan`` (produced by the File Generation
   Planning Engine).

The resolution engine is **forbidden** from reading the user's request.

Design principles
-----------------
* **Every dependency is known before construction begins.**  No
  library, framework, or tool is invented during code generation —
  they are all resolved here.
* **One responsibility per dependency.**  Each dependency entry carries
  a single, clear reason for existing.
* **No dependency without a reason.**  Every dependency entry records
  *why* it is needed (``reason``).
* **No dependency without a source.**  Every dependency is linked to
  at least one detected component or to the project infrastructure.
* **Version compatibility.**  Every dependency records its suggested
  version and the version constraints that make it compatible with the
  language, framework, operating system, and other dependencies.
* **Conflict detection.**  The report records every conflict found
  (version conflicts, duplicates, unused dependencies, circular
  dependencies, broken dependencies).
* **Security awareness.**  The report flags dependencies with bad
  reputation, untrusted sources, or known-vulnerable versions.
* **Optimization.**  The report records optimization notes (minimize
  libraries, prefer official, avoid abandoned/unstable).
* **Extensibility.**  New dependencies can be added to the report
  without redesigning the existing structure — the report is built to
  grow with the project.

The report is a plain data container — no logic lives here.  The
resolution engine and its helpers populate it; downstream consumers
(the code generators, the manager, tests) read it.

    framework, or tool that the project will use — it is **not** the
    library itself, nor does it contain any code or installation
    instructions.

        name: The dependency name (e.g. ``"python-telegram-bot"``,
            ``"SQLAlchemy"``).
        type: The dependency type (one of the
            ``DEPENDENCY_TYPE_*`` constants).
        suggested_version: The suggested version (e.g. ``"21.x"``,
            ``">=2.0,<3.0"``, ``"latest"``).
        version_constraint: The version constraint that must be
            satisfied for compatibility (e.g.
            ``">=2.0,<3.0"``).
        reason: A human-readable explanation of *why* this dependency
            is needed.
        source: Where this dependency was discovered (one of the
            ``SOURCE_*`` constants).
        source_components: The detected component names that require
            this dependency.
        priority: The broad resolution phase (one of the
            ``DEPENDENCY_PRIORITY_*`` constants).  Lower values are
            resolved first.
        depends_on: The names of other dependencies this one depends
            on.
        depended_by: The names of dependencies that depend on this
            one.
        load_order: The precise position in the installation/load
            sequence (lower first).  Assigned by the dependency graph
            builder.
        language: The programming language this dependency is for
            (e.g. ``"python"``).
        framework: The framework this dependency belongs to or
            requires (e.g. ``"python-telegram-bot"``).
        os_compatibility: The operating systems this dependency is
            compatible with (e.g. ``["linux", "windows", "macos"]``).
        reputation: The reputation of the dependency (one of the
            ``REPUTATION_*`` constants).
        trust: The trust level (one of the ``TRUST_*`` constants).
        stability: The stability level (one of the
            ``STABILITY_*`` constants).
        official: ``True`` when this is an official/maintained
            dependency.

            added later without redesign.
